# Weekend-Taxis-Rides-Metrics-Pipeline

## Purpose
The objective of this project is to fetch and analyze monthly metrics related to weekend taxi rides in New York City between 2014 and 2016. 
The metrics include the average number of trips, average fare per trip, and average duration per trip for both Saturdays and Sundays. 
The data is sourced from the New York City taxi trip dataset stored in a Clickhouse database.
